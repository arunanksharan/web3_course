    "5. Inheritance: contract <_Child_> is <_Parent1_>, <_Parent2_> {}\n",

    "6. FunctionName: name of the function | called in transaction from EoA | another contract | within same contract\n",

    "14. constant/view: no modification of state\n",
    "15. payable: can accept incoming payments | Exceptions: coinbase payments & SELFDESTRUCT inheritance will be paid even if fallback function is not declared as payable - this makes sense because code execution is not part of those payments anyway\n",
    "16. modifiers: used to create conditions that apply to many functions within a contract | access control | onlyOwner - require(msg.sender == owner)\n",

When a contract terminates with an error, all the state changes (changes to variables, balances, etc.) are reverted, all the way up the chain of contract calls if more than one contract was called. This ensures that transactions are atomic, meaning they either complete successfully or have no effect on state and are reverted entirely.\n",
    "21. assert: Evaluating a condition and stopping execution with an error if the condition is false. By convention, assert is used when the outcome is expected to be true, meaning that we use assert to test internal conditions\n",
    "22. require: require is used when testing inputs (such as function arguments or transaction fields), setting our expectations for those conditions | acts as a gate condition | require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the contract owner can call this function\")\n",
    "23. revert: halt execution and revert state changes\n",
    "24. throw: obsolete\n",
    "\n",
    "### Events\n",
    "25. Transaction Receipt: Produced on completion of transaction | Contains log entries providing information about actions during execution of transaction\n",
    "26. Events: solidity high level objects used to construct these logs | USed by Dapps and light clients - listen to specific events and report to UI | change state in app to reflect change in contract state\n",
    "27. event Deposit(address indexed from, uint amount);\n",

    "### Notes from Writing Smart Contracts:\n",
    "30. Use i_ as prefix for immutable values - eg: setting minimum_degen_amount for entering into raffle => i_minimum_degen_amount\n",

    "1. Uses resource types with move sematics to own and transfer assets\n",
    "2. Modules: libraries - define struct types and functions operating on these struct types\n",
    "3. Module Syntax: ```module <address>::<identifier> {\n",
    "    (<use> | <friend> | <type> | <function> | <constant>)*\n",
    "}```\n",
    "4. Fundamentally, a module is a collection of ```types``` and ```functions```.\n",
    "5. The ```use``` keyword is used to import types from other modules.\n",
    "6. The ```friend``` keyword specifies a list of trusted modules.\n",
    "7. The ```const``` keyword defines private constants that can be used in the functions of a module.\n",
    "8. Struct Types: define schema of global storage & module functions define the rules for updating this storage\n",
    "9. Scripts: limited power - only invoke module functions | executale entrypoint (like main) | call functions of published module to eventually update global storage\n",
    "10. Publishing module + executing cripts => separate VM functions\n",
    "11. Integer types of one size can be cast to integer types of another size. Integers are the only types in Move that support casting.\n",
    "12. Implicitly copyable: integer | bool | address || vector values can be copied only if the elements can be copied\n",
    "13. Signer values are not copyable, meaning they cannot be copied from any operation whether it be through an explicit copy instruction or through a dereference *\n",
    "14. ```address``` - built-in move type - represent location - account in global storage | 256-bit (32-byte) identifier | modules and resources stored at an address | can use runtime address value to access resource at the address but not modules\n",
    "15. Move addresses are intentionally opaque - they cannot be created from integers, they do not support arithmetic operations, and they cannot be modified | designed from the ground up to support static verification\n",
    "16. Syntax of a numerical address - not restricted to hex-encoded values, and any valid u256 numerical value can be used as an address value, e.g., 42, 0xCAFE, and 2021 are all valid numerical address literals\n",
    "17. address values are used with the exists, borrow_global, borrow_global_mut, and move_from operations | The only global storage operation that does not use address is move_to, which uses signer\n",
    "18. ```vector<T>``` - only primitive collection type provided by Move | A vector<T> - homogenous collection of T's - grow or shrink by pushing/popping values off the \"end\" | instantiated with any type T | vector<u64>, vector<address>, vector<0x42::MyModule::MyResource>, and vector<vector<u8>> are all valid vector types.\n",
    "19. Common use-case for vectors - represent \"byte arrays\" - represented with vector<u8> | used for cryptographic purposes - public key, hash result\n",
    "20. Two supported types of vector<u8> literals, byte strings - quoted string literals prefixed by a b, e.g. b\"Hello!\\n\" || hex strings - quoted string literals prefixed by a x, e.g. x\"48656C6C6F210A\"\n",
    "21. ```signer``` - built-in move resource type - capability that allows the holder to act on behalf of a particular address | ```struct signer has drop { a: address }``` | similar to a Unix UID in that it represents a user authenticated by code outside of Move (e.g., by checking a cryptographic signature or password)\n",
    "22. ```signer``` vs ```address``` - Move program can create any address value without special permission using address literals | signer values are special because they cannot be created via literals or instructions - ```only by the Move VM```\\\n",
    "23. ```script { use std::signer; fun main(s: signer) {assert!(signer::address_of(&s) == @0x42, 0);}}```\n",
    "24. ```move_to<T>(&signer, T)``` global storage operator requires a &signer argument to publish a resource T under signer.address's account. This ensures that only an authenticated user can elect to publish a resource under their address\n",
    "25. References: immutable and mutable &mut || Immutable references = read only | cannot modify the underlying value (or any of its fields). || Mutable references - modifications via a write through that reference\n",
    "26. In order for a reference to be read, the underlying type must have the copy ability as reading the reference creates a new copy of the value. This rule prevents the copying of resource values.\n",
    "27. Dually: in order for a reference to be written to, the underlying type must have the drop ability as writing to the reference will discard (or \"drop\") the old value. This rule prevents the destruction of resource values.\n",
    "28. References and tuples are the only types that cannot be stored as a field value of structs, which also means that they cannot exist in global storage || All references created during program execution = destroyed when a Move program terminates; they are entirely ephemeral. This invariant is also true for values of types without the store ability, but note that references and tuples go a step further by never being allowed in structs in the first place.\n",
    "29. This is another difference between Move and Rust, which allows references to be stored inside of structs.\n",
    "30. Move cannot support this because references cannot be serialized, but every Move value must be serializable This requirement comes from Move's persistent global storage, which needs to serialize values to persist them across program executions. Structs can be written to global storage, and thus they must be serializable\n",
    "31. Tuples: Move does not fully support tuples as a first-class value | To support multiple return values, Move has tuple-like expressions\n",
    "32. unit () is a type created by the Move source language in order to be expression based\n",
    "33. Valid variable names: underscores _, letters a to z, letters A to Z, and digits 0 to 9 | Must start with either an underscore _ or a letter a through z | cannot start with uppercase letters\n",
    "34. move and copy\n",
    "35. ```structs```: user-defined data structure containing typed fields | refer to struct values as resources if they cannot be copied and cannot be dropped | structs - cannot be copied, cannot be dropped, and cannot be stored in global storage | linear and ephemeral - all values have to have ownership transferred (linear) and the values must be dealt with by the end of the program's execution (ephemeral)\n",
    "36. Defining ```structs```: must be defined inside a module || ```struct Foo has copy, drop { x: u64, y: bool };    struct Bar {}``` | structs can be granted abilities by annotating them with has ```<ability>``` || Naming: Structs must start with a capital letter A to Z\n",
    "37. Only structs with the key ability can be saved directly in persistent global storage. All values stored within those key structs must have the store ability\n",
    "38. ```constants```: Constants are a way of giving a name to shared, static values inside of a module or script. The constant's must be known at compilation. The constant's value is stored in the compiled module or script || const ```<name>: <type> = <expression>;``` || Constants must start with a capital letter A to Z || limited to the primitive types bool, u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, u256, address, and vector<u8>\n",
    "39. ```generics```: parametric polymorphism - \n",
    "40. ```abilities```: Typing feature in Move that control what actions are permissible for values of a given type || gating access to certain bytecode instructions so that for a value to be used with the bytecode instruction, it must have the ability required\n",
    "41. Four abilities are: Copy - Allows values of types with this ability to be copied | drop - Allows values of types with this ability to be popped/dropped | store - Allows values of types with this ability to exist inside a struct in global storage | key - Allows the type to serve as a key for global storage operations\n",
    "42. ```use``` syntax can be used to create aliases to members in other modules: ```use <address>::<module name> as <module alias name>;```\n",
    "43. friend syntax is used to declare modules that are trusted by the current module. A trusted module is allowed to call any function defined in the current module that have the public(friend) visibility || Friend modules must be within the same account address || Friends relationships cannot create cyclic module dependencies\n",
    "44. Global Storage - Structure - The purpose of Move programs is to read from and write to tree-shaped persistent global storage. Programs cannot access the filesystem, network, or any other data outside of this tree. | ```struct GlobalStorage {\n",
